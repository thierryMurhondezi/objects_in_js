// Objects in JavaScript are a little more complex than arrays, but they're also very powerful. An object is a data structure that can contain multiple properties and methods. Each property has a name and a value, and each method is a function that can be executed


Here's an example of a simple object:
- var myObject = { name: "John", age: 23, hobby: "hiking" };
This object has three properties: name, age, and hobby. Each property has a different value. You can access the properties of an object using dot notation, like this:
- myObject.name; //
